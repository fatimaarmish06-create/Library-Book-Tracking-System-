In this project, I primarily worked on the heap-based scheduling and task execution logic. My responsibility was to design and implement a system where tasks are managed efficiently using priority queues, ensuring that higher-priority tasks are executed first.

Through this work, I gained a deeper understanding of how multiple data structures can work together within a single system to solve complex problems. Integrating heaps with supporting structures strengthened my ability to design efficient and maintainable algorithms.

One of the most valuable learning experiences was debugging heap ordering issues. Resolving these problems helped me understand the internal behavior of priority queues, particularly how insertion, deletion, and reordering affect overall system performance and correctness.

If given additional time, I would focus on optimizing update operations to reduce duplication and improve efficiency. This would further enhance performance and make the scheduling system more scalable.

Overall, this project significantly improved my problem-solving skills, data structure knowledge, and debugging techniques, and provided practical experience in building efficient scheduling systems.
