In the peaceful world of Booklandia Library, students wandered in confusion searching for missing books.
Then arrived HashTable Haris, the lightning-fast finder who could locate any book in just a moment.
Beside him worked LinkedList Armish, a flexible organizer who could add or remove books without any trouble.
Queue Taha, calm and patient, managed long lines of students waiting for popular books in perfect order.
Array Mohid, the precise record-keeper, stored every student’s borrowing details neatly and accurately.
Soon they were joined by Tree Zahra, the wise categorizer who arranged books into perfect sections and genres.
And Graph Khizra, the smart connector, mapped all book relationships and helped users navigate the entire library easily.
Together, this team of Data Structure Heroes built an automated Library Book Tracking System to help busy librarians.
Books could now be added, searched, issued, and returned without delays or mistakes.
With their powerful skills combined, Booklandia became the most efficient, organized, and error-free library ever seen.
